### Who where they?

One is focusing on animation, the other is focusing on game design. They are both on a Game Development BA(Hons) at Falmouth University.

### What did we learn?

While some of the questions I asked led to answers that gave nothing that inspired our design or content, there were two specific questions that gave a vital insight into what drew them into their current course.

When I asked why they decided to study at Falmouth University, they told me that the uni offered something the others weren't. Anywhere else, all that was offered was coding and not much of the creative aspect they desired! But at Falmouth, while they were applying for the same course, they were free to choose which part of the industry they wanted to (Game Design and Animation).

The other question relating to improving their skills let them express why they chose the course, it was because either; they only needed to improve the skills they needed, or any new skills they needed would be taught on the course.

So what we learn from this is that the content we use on our site should express that the course helps creative people improve their skills, and pursue their interests on the course. In addition we should bare in mind how different the way of assessment is for our course and how that sets it apart from other courses of the same subject.
