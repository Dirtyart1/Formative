### Dom, Peyman, Ricardo, Muhammed, Callum
On this team project we designed and built a website for our Ravensbourne Web Media degree course. We looked at competitors and did audience research in order to create the best page to best advertise our course. We went in detail about the content we will need to include as well as what kind of fonts and colours we would use.

### What have we learnt?

After looking at 3 competitor course sites we have learnt a lot about how we want to structure our own site and what kind of language to use. These 3 sites are very different and we took all of the good points and the bad points of each site and sat down and looked at what we could do in terms of our own site.

2 of these sites are very word heavy and we looked into how we could maybe improve this but also keep the content that we need. The Bath Spa site as you can see above is very nicely laid out and so we want to take inspiration from this site and greatly improve it. The other 2 sites as you can see are very text heavy.

### How do your personas represent your target audience(s)?

They are young people looking to start uni in the next academic year, in addition they are looking to enroll in a media orientated course. What they all share is that they are worried about the job prospects for after the course as well as what the course itself will involve. Some of the personas were also worried about joining a course that was heavily academic and are worried about aspects like exams.

### What language do your personas respond to?

Using words that are buzz words for a course page would be great for parents and people who apply for these types of courses. The parent wants to see language that appeals to them, they want to see professional text but also want to feel secure in what they are feeling when choosing the course.

### What information are your personas looking for?

- Information about what current students currently on the course and what itâ€™s like to be a student on the course.
- Employability rates
- Details about the course over the 3 years i.e. modules that you will doing during the years.


## :telephone: Interviews :pager:

### Who where they?

One is focusing on animation, the other is focusing on game design. They are both on a Game Development BA(Hons) at Falmouth University.

### What did we learn?

While some of the questions I asked led to answers that gave nothing that inspired our design or content, there were two specific questions that gave a vital insight into what drew them into their current course.

When I asked why they decided to study at Falmouth University, they told me that the uni offered something the others weren't. Anywhere else, all that was offered was coding and not much of the creative aspect they desired! But at Falmouth, while they were applying for the same course, they were free to choose which part of the industry they wanted to (Game Design and Animation).

The other question relating to improving their skills let them express why they chose the course, it was because either; they only needed to improve the skills they needed, or any new skills they needed would be taught on the course.

So what we learn from this is that the content we use on our site should express that the course helps creative people improve their skills, and pursue their interests on the course. In addition we should bare in mind how different the way of assessment is for our course and how that sets it apart from other courses of the same subject.

## Mood board & wireframes

Above you can see our 2 mock ups and wireframes we tried to keep it colourful on one and then very conten full on the other. We looked at colours and type faces we could potentially use and what it would look like in the final product. We looked at the following elements when creating these mock-ups;

- Colours
- Fonts
- Images
- Content

After looking at these elements we created the mockups and then started to gather some ideas for our final design.

Above are some screeshots of our moodboard we had on pinterest and we have a wide variety of web designs on there. Our group took great inspiration from the bright and vibrant designs. Moodboard is [here](https://uk.pinterest.com/domonicbishop/web-media-site/)
