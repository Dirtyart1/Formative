### What have we learnt?

After looking at 3 competitor course sites we have learnt a lot about how we want to structure our own site and what kind of language to use. These 3 sites are very different and we took all of the good points and the bad points of each site and sat down and looked at what we could do in terms of our own site.

2 of these sites are very word heavy and we looked into how we could maybe improve this but also keep the content that we need. The Bath Spa site as you can see above is very nicely laid out and so we want to take inspiration from this site and greatly improve it. The other 2 sites as you can see are very text heavy.

### Who where they?

One is focusing on animation, the other is focusing on game design. They are both on a Game Development BA(Hons) at Falmouth University.

### What did we learn?

While some of the questions I asked led to answers that gave nothing that inspired our design or content, there were two specific questions that gave a vital insight into what drew them into their current course.

When I asked why they decided to study at Falmouth University, they told me that the uni offered something the others weren't. Anywhere else, all that was offered was coding and not much of the creative aspect they desired! But at Falmouth, while they were applying for the same course, they were free to choose which part of the industry they wanted to (Game Design and Animation).

The other question relating to improving their skills let them express why they chose the course, it was because either; they only needed to improve the skills they needed, or any new skills they needed would be taught on the course.

So what we learn from this is that the content we use on our site should express that the course helps creative people improve their skills, and pursue their interests on the course. In addition we should bare in mind how different the way of assessment is for our course and how that sets it apart from other courses of the same subject.
